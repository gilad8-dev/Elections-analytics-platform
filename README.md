# Politicalculator - Demo version

A full-stack political quiz that maps voters across four ideological axes and recommends the closest-matching political parties.

Users answer 52 questions, receive scores on four independent 0<->100 axes, and get personalised party recommendations based on their results. With consent, anonymous submissions are stored and visualised in a live dashboard. This public demo version includes one open-access dashboard backed by synthetic demo data.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install          # install dependencies
npm run seed         # populate the demo database (500 synthetic submissions)
npm start            # start the server: (1) Quiz pgae → http://localhost:3000
                     #                   (2) Dashboard → http://localhost:3000/dashboard
```

> The database is created automatically at `data/` on first run. No `.env` file or secrets are needed.

## Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE submissions (
  id                  TEXT PRIMARY KEY,   -- UUID v4
  created_at          TEXT NOT NULL,      -- ISO 8601 date (YYYY-MM-DD)
  survey_version      TEXT NOT NULL,      -- e.g. "1.3"
  answers             TEXT NOT NULL,      -- JSON array of 52 integers
  axis_scores         TEXT NOT NULL,      -- JSON array of 4 floats [0–100]
  recommended_parties TEXT NOT NULL,      -- JSON array of 4 party ID strings
  is_female           INTEGER NOT NULL,   -- 0 = male, 1 = female
  language            TEXT NOT NULL       -- "he" | "ar" | "ru"
);
```

No personally identifiable information is stored. No IP addresses, no names, no emails.

> **Demo data:** The database shipped in this repo contains 500 synthetic submissions generated by `server/seed.js`. It is entirely fictional and safe for public use.

## Scoring Engine

Each of the 52 questions belongs to one of four ideological axes. Questions carry `x` (strongly agree/disagree weight) and `y` (agree/disagree weight) parameters and can be marked `inverted` to flip their direction.

The axis score formula (in `js/scoring.js`):

```
rawScore = Σ (answer weight for each question on this axis)
score    = ((rawScore - MIN_POSSIBLE) / RANGE) * 100
```

Result: a float in [0, 100] per axis, computed entirely on the client before submission.

---

## Bumping the Survey Version

When you change questions or scoring weights, update `SURVEY_VERSION` in [js/app.js](js/app.js):

```js
var SURVEY_VERSION = '1.4'; // bump this
```

This lets you segment submissions by version in analytics.
